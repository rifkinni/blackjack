# Learning OOP with Blackjack

This repository is intended to be a teaching tool for understanding object oriented programming. 

Start by taking a look at the /card.py, /hand.py, and /player.py classes. 

In addition to the class, each file has some example code that tests the functionality under `if __name__ == "__main__":`. 

When you are ready, try implementing the pseudo-code outlined in /game.py by taking advantage of the logic in the other classes.
