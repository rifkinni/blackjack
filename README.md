# Learning OOP with Blackjack

This repository is intended to be a teaching tool for understanding object oriented programming. 

Start by taking a look at the https://github.com/rifkinni/blackjack/blob/master/card.py, https://github.com/rifkinni/blackjack/blob/master/hand.py, and https://github.com/rifkinni/blackjack/blob/master/player.py classes.

In addition to the class, each file has some example code that tests the functionality under `if __name__ == "__main__":`. 

When you are ready, try implementing the pseudo-code outlined in https://github.com/rifkinni/blackjack/blob/master/game.py by taking advantage of the logic in the other classes.
